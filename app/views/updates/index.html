      <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-m">26 November 2025: new vaccinator role</h2>
      <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
        <li>In <b>Manage users</b>, when you add a user, you are now asked if the user is a vaccinator. This replaces a previous question that asked if the user was a registered clinician. Any user previously added to RAVS as a registered clinician will now appear as a vaccinator.</li>
        <li>In <b>Record vaccinations</b>, when you select a vaccinator, the list of names is now populated with all users who have the role of vaccinator. If a vaccinator is missing from the list, make sure they are a vaccinator in Manage users.</li>
        <li>In <b>Find a patient</b>, when you select a vaccinator, the list of names now only includes users who have the role of vaccinator. Previously it included all users. If a vaccinator is missing from the list, make sure they are a vaccinator in Manage users.</li>
