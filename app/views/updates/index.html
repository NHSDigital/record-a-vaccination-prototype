      <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-m">26 November 2025: new vaccinator role</h2>
      <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
        <li>In <b>Manage users</b>, when you add a user, you are now asked if the user is a vaccinator. This replaces a previous question that asked if the user was a registered clinician. Any user previously added to RAVS as a registered clinician will now appear as a vaccinator.</li>
        <li>In <b>Record vaccinations</b>, when you select a vaccinator, the list of names is now populated with all users who have the role of vaccinator. If a vaccinator is missing from the list, make sure they are a vaccinator in Manage users.</li>
        <li>In <b>Find a patient</b>, when you select a vaccinator, the list of names now only includes users who have the role of vaccinator. Previously it included all users. If a vaccinator is missing from the list, make sure they are a vaccinator in Manage users.</li>
        
      </ul>

      <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-m">12 November 2025: changing eligibility</h3>

      <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
        <li>When you record the same vaccination for the next patient, you can now change the eligibility details (including healthcare worker role) on the 'Check if these details still apply' page.</li>
         
      </ul>

      <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-m">29 September 2025: new sections added</h2>

      <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
        <li><b>Record vaccinations</b> is a new simpler way to record vaccinations. It will eventually replace the Find a patient section.</li>
        <li><b>Records</b> is a new section where you can view and edit records.</li>
