      <p>Your email address {{ data.email }} is associated with a different log in method.</p>

      <p>If you would like to be able to use both log in methods, first sign in using the way you used before:</p>

        href: "/auth/okta-sign-in"
      }) }}

        {{ button({
          text: "Log in with PharmaPMR",
          classes: "nhsuk-button--secondary app-button--min-width-2"

      <div>
        {{ button({

      </div>


      <p>We will then link both log in methods to your account and in future you can log in either way.</p>
